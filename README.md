## # What is pomodoro technique
The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late 1980s by then-university student Francesco Cirillo. Cirillo was struggling to focus on his studies and complete assignments. Feeling overwhelmed, he asked himself to commit to just 10 minutes of focused study time. Encouraged by the challenge, he found a tomato (pomodoro in Italian) shaped kitchen timer, which then become the pomodoro technique or timer icon, and the Pomodoro technique was born. Usually pomodoro timer use following time management: 25 minutes to focus and 5 minutes to break, and 1 cycle pomodoro time is 2 focus session and 2 break session.
